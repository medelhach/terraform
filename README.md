# terraform Introduction
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. 
Terraform can help with multi-cloud by having one workflow for all clouds. The infrastructure Terraform manages can be hosted on public clouds like Amazon Web Services,
Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, or on-prem in private clouds such as VMWare vSphere, OpenStack, or CloudStack.
Terraform treats infrastructure as code (IaC) so you never have to worry about you infrastructure drifting away from its desired configuration.
